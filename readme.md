# Data visualisation engineer 

## Design a Dashboard for Investors and Investments

You aim to conceptualize and design a dashboard that displays key information about
investors and their investments. The idea is that using your expertise, you create a cohesive
visualization that has value, is visually pleasing, and has a good UX.
There are no requirements for what specifically should be shown on screen, we want to assess
your ability to turn raw data into value.
You are expected to deliver a front-end platform in React.js, using D3.js (or a wrapper library
like Nivo) to generate data visualizations. Typescript is optional.
