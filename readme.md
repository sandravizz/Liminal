# Data visualisation engineer 

## Design a Dashboard for Investors and Investments

## Instructions

You aim to conceptualize and design a dashboard that displays key information about
investors and their investments. The idea is that using your expertise, you create a cohesive
visualization that has value, is visually pleasing, and has a good UX.
There are no requirements for what specifically should be shown on screen, we want to assess
your ability to turn raw data into value.
You are expected to deliver a front-end platform in React.js, using D3.js (or a wrapper library
like Nivo) to generate data visualizations. Typescript is optional.

## Preparation

#### Data cleaning and processing
In the [first step](https://observablehq.com/d/5ae7f207809e418b?collection=@sandraviz/liminal) checked the dataset and variables and did some cleaning. 

##### Visualisation: Investors (Entity vs. Person)
In the [second step](https://observablehq.com/d/9839cdc79406e156?collection=@sandraviz/liminal) I checked the investors through a ranking visualisation. 

##### Visualisation: Investments
In the [third step](https://observablehq.com/d/1822f94eb67efc32?collection=@sandraviz/liminal) I checked the investment through a ranking visualisation. 

#### Dataset for the sankey 
In the [forth step](https://observablehq.com/d/287f65b4ed6e3521?collection=@sandraviz/liminal) I create the data files for the sankey. 

#### Sankey investors vs. investments
In the [fith step](https://observablehq.com/d/0b719034860b8bbb?collection=@sandraviz/liminal) I sketch the sankey idea using d3.js.  

#### Sankey segments vs. investors
In the [sixth step](https://observablehq.com/d/efd395409ebc2dc6?collection=@sandraviz/liminal) I create anthor sankey connectig the solution segments to the investors. Didn't use it in the final verison.
